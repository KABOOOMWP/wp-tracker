# WP Tracker

A padel match scoring app for smartwatches. Built with Kotlin Multiplatform, targeting **Wear OS** and **watchOS**.

---

## Overview

WP Tracker lets you track a live padel match from your wrist. Tap to score points, undo mistakes with a long-press, and follow the current serve side, score layout, and match status at a glance.

**Supported formats:**
- Singles and Doubles
- Best-of-3 or Best-of-5 sets
- Standard rules (deuce/advantage)
- Golden Point (one deciding point at deuce)
- Star Point (advantage ×2, then one deciding point)
- Tie-break scoring with automatic serve rotation

### Shared module

All padel scoring logic lives in the `shared` module as pure Kotlin with no platform dependencies.

- **`MatchEngine`** — stateless object; `score(snapshot, team)` returns a new `Snapshot`
- **`Snapshot`** — immutable data class representing the complete match state at any point in time
- **`Config`** — match settings set once at start (rule mode, play mode, serve order, best-of)

The caller (each platform's ViewModel/Store) maintains a history stack of `Snapshot` objects. Undo is simply popping the last entry.

### Data flow

```
User tap → ViewModel/Store → MatchEngine.score() → new Snapshot → UI re-renders
                                                  ↑
                                        History stack (for undo)
```

### State model

| Class | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Config` | `bestOf`, `ruleMode`, `playMode`, `serveOrder` |
| `MatchState` | Sets won, set scores, match timestamps |
| `SetState` | Current set index and game scores |
| `GameState` | Points, game phase (Normal/Deuce/Advantage/Golden/Star), rally index |
| `ServeState` | Current server, serve side, order index |
| `StatsState` | Total points, breaks, deuces, golden deciders |

### Status pill priority

The UI shows a contextual pill label derived by `MatchEngine.computePill()`:

`MATCH POINT > SET POINT > BREAK POINT > GOLDEN POINT > STAR POINT > TIEBREAK > (hidden)`

## Building

### Prerequisites

- **Android / Wear OS:** Android Studio (latest stable), Android SDK 36
- **watchOS:** Xcode (latest stable), macOS

### Wear OS

1. Open `code/` in Android Studio.
2. Select the `wearos` run configuration.
3. Deploy to a Wear OS emulator or physical device.

To run shared module tests:

```bash
cd code
./gradlew :shared:commonTest
```

### watchOS

The watchOS app requires the compiled `Shared.xcframework`. Build it first from the `code/` directory:

```bash
cd code
./gradlew :shared:assembleSharedXCFramework
```

Then open `code/watchos/WPTrackerWatch.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run on a watchOS simulator or device.

---

## Key Dependencies

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| Kotlin | 2.3.10 |
| Android Gradle Plugin | 9.1.0 |
| Compose BOM | 2026.02.01 |
| Wear Compose | 1.5.6 |
| Kotlinx Coroutines | 1.10.2 |

All version pinning is managed via `code/gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

---

## Testing

Tests live in `code/shared/src/commonTest/` and cover:

- Game phase transitions (Normal → Deuce → Advantage → Win)
- Serve rotation (singles, doubles, tie-break)
- Undo chain integrity
- Status pill detection and priority
- Match and set completion conditions
- Golden Point and Star Point deciding points
- Score position (diagonal alternation)
- Invariants (no impossible states)

Run all shared tests:

```bash
cd code
./gradlew :shared:commonTest
```

---

## CI/CD

Recommended pipeline (e.g. GitHub Actions):

**On every push / pull request:**

1. Run shared module unit tests

   ```bash
   ./gradlew :shared:commonTest
   ```

2. Build the Wear OS APK (debug)

   ```bash
   ./gradlew :wearos:assembleDebug
   ```

3. Build the XCFramework for watchOS

   ```bash
   ./gradlew :shared:assembleSharedXCFramework
   ```

4. Build the watchOS app via `xcodebuild` (simulator target)

**On merge to `main`:**

1. Run the full release build for both platforms
2. Sign and upload the Wear OS APK to the Play Console internal track
3. Archive the watchOS build for TestFlight distribution via `xcodebuild archive` + `altool`
